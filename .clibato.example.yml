# Example: .clibato.yml
# ======

# The 'contents' section is a list of files to backup/restore.
#
# Each key is a 'backup path' - a relative path representing a unique file.
# The file will be stored at the backup path during the backup process.
#
# Here are some sample entries.
contents:

  # The .zshrc entry implies that "$HOME/.zshrc" will be stored at
  #  "$BACKUP/.zshrc". Clibato will look for the file in the user's
  # home directory.
  .zshrc:

  # The .bunnyrc entry specifies the location of the original file,
  # i.e. ~/Documents/readme.md.
  .bunnyrc: '~/Documents/bunnyrc'

  # The blinky.md entry specifies an absolute path to the original file.
  blinky.md: '/var/www/blinky.md'

  # The chaos.rb entry specifies a backup path that is very different from
  # the source. This implies that "$HOME/code/poopify.rb" will be stored at
  # "$BACKUP/i/m/chaos.rb". This will surely cause confusion though.
  i/m/chaos.rb: '~/code/poopify.rb'

#
# The 'destination' section defines where the backup should be placed.
#
# Choose and configure a destination based on the examples.
destination:
  type: "directory|repository"
  path: "/backup"

#
# Example: Directory
#
# Copies files to a backup directory.
destination.directory:
  type: "directory"
  # Absolute path to the directory to store the backup.
  # The directory must exist - it won't be created automatically.
  path: "~/backup"

#
# Example: Repository
#
# Pushes backups to a Git repository.
destination.repository:
  type: "repository"
  # The in which the backup will be prepared.
  path: "~/backup"
  # URL to a Git repository.
  remote: "git@github.com:USER/SLUG.git"
  # The branch to which to make the backup commit.
  # If the branch doesn't exist, it will be created.
  branch: "main"
  # The name and mail identify the author of the git commit.
  user:
    name: "John Doe"
    mail: "john.doe@example.com"
